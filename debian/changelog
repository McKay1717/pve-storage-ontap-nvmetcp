pve-storage-ontap-nvmetcp (1.0-3) stable; urgency=high

  * fix: ONTAP REST API pagination — follow _links.next across all
    paginated responses. list_images was limited to 20 records,
    causing volumes to be invisible when SVM had >20 objects.
  * fix: implement clone_image (full clone via dd between NVMe devices)
    and restore volume_has_feature('copy') to enable VM cloning.
  * fix: untaint NVMe device paths for Perl taint mode (pvedaemon -T).
    Paths from nvme-cli JSON, sysfs, and config were tainted, causing
    "Insecure dependency in exec" errors during clone/qemu-img operations.
  * fix: untaint NVMe/TCP portal addresses from ONTAP API and config.
  * fix: ONTAP version requirement 9.18+ → 9.10.1+ in control.in
    and Api.pm (9.18 does not exist).
  * fix: missing \n on die in on_add_hook error path.
  * fix: URI escaping on vol_name, cg_name, subsystem_name in API
    query strings — prevents malformed HTTP requests with special
    characters in storage_prefix.
  * fix: removed unused imports (get_standard_option, trim).
  * feat: force discard=unmap and detect-zeroes=unmap at QEMU
    blockdev layer — automatic thin reclaim on ONTAP.
  * feat: verify_ssl property — TLS certificate verification for
    ONTAP management connections (default: off).
  * feat: debug property — configurable debug logging (0/1/2)
    output to syslog via pvedaemon journal.
  * doc: added SECURITY.md, GitHub issue templates.
